TODO
- Changement de couleurs par level
- victory vfx: blur? others?
- ic√¥ne
- Options: 1 min ou 5 min?


Bugs:
- local storage save files can be mixed with other game savefiles on itch.io. Need to add tag in front.
- If i reload a save in win state, I can't click and cells don't animates
- after cheat win, the next nb is always the same as before cheat
- Mouse over, then leave quickly: text remain visible. Fix: check mouse position every 5 sec, hide text if mouse didn't move.



release:
- page itch.io
- description & readme sur github
- vaguely inspired by Vesper5 and pretty colors in general
