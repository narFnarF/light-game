TODO
- Correctly detect win state with the global variable nbLights
- Changement de couleurs par level
- victory vfx: blur? others?
- ic√¥ne
- Options: 1 min ou 5 min?


Bugs:
- all cells can be lit even if I didn't roll = maxRoll (ex: 23/24 lights all cells, but is not winning condition)
- after cheat win, the next nb is always the same as before cheat
- Mouse over, then leave quickly: text remain visible. Fix: check mouse position every 5 sec, hide text if mouse didn't move.



release:
- page itch.io
- description & readme sur github
- vaguely inspired by Vesper5 and pretty colors in general
